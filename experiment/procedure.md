1) Clean the sample ultrasonically with acetone/ethanol as medium<br>
2) Clean the syringe and fill it with the required liquid with which the test is to be conducted<br>
3) Place the sample on the sample stage<br>
4) Turn - on the Illumination lamp and CCD camera<br>
5) Make sure the sample stage is properly labeled<br>
6) Open the syringe knob to allow a liquid drop to come out and let it fall on the sample.Drop acquires the shape<br>
7) Click on the software which measures the contact angle at both the ends (θC1 and θC2)<br>
8) Repeat the experiment at least 5 times at different positions of the sample<br>
9) Take the arithmetic mean of the θC1 and θC2 to obtain the contact angle
